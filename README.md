## Introduction

-This repo contains code to perform Data Analysis on Ames area housing located in Iowa, USA housing Dataset that can be found here  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashanknecrothapa/ames-housing-dataset.

-The dataset contains various features and attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA.

-The feature documentation can be found here https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AmesHousing/AmesHousing.pdf


## Problem Statement

-Develop a machine learning model to predict the sale price of a residential property in Ames, Iowa. The model should leverage key housing characteristics, such as living area, basement size, garage size, overall quality, number of fireplaces and bathrooms, and age, to accurately estimate the sale price.

-The Goal of this project is to determine different attributes of the house that Influence its price using Linear Regression

-The Goal of this project is to determine different attributes of the house that Influence its price group(High Price or Low Price) using Logistic Regression
